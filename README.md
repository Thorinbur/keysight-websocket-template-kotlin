# keysight-websocket-template-kotlin

This is a sample socket.io server build using kotlin capable of communicating with Keysight and moving the camera. 
This is just a template and Proof of Concept and is not ment to be used as is but it goes throught the hassle of setting dependencies and minimal structure needed to achieve the goal of moving the camera via remote websocket connection.
